Reminder to create a new branch with the task name (ex: backend-5-jy) <br>
Delete your branch after you merge changes <br>
Make sure to git checkout (branch-name) when you work on code <br>

If changes have been pushed to main and you haven't updated your branch with the current changes: <br>
git checkout main <br>
git pull <br>
git checkout (your-branch) <br>
git merge main <br>
Then resolve your conflicts within vscode
