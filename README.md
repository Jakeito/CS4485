Reminder to create a new branch with the task name (ex: backend-5-jy) <br>
Delete your branch after you merge changes <br>
Make sure to git checkout <branch-name> when you work on code <br>

If changes have been pushed to main and you haven't updated your branch with the current changes:
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout <your-branch>
git merge main
Then resolve your conflicts within vscode
